# Institute-Website-Code
This project is a practice website that I developed to enhance my front-end development skills.  Through this project, I practiced building layouts with HTML, styling with CSS, and adding interactivity using JavaScript.  It is not a live product but serves as a portfolio example of my learning and experimentation.
